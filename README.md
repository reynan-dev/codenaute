# ClapClap Monorepo

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) built-in support to manage our monorepository.

## :arrow_forward: How to run `front`

1. Setup env by running `pnpm install` or `pnpm --filter front install`
2. Run `pnpm --filter front dev`

## Common workspace

Common worspace is used to share code between `front` <> `back`.

## Git hooks

We use [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to ease git hooks.

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specs for our commit message and this is check on `pre-commit`.
We use the same prefixes for branch names and this is also checked on `pre-commit`.

### Branch names

See the regex validating the branch naming [here](.husky/branch-naming).

**Structure :**

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

**Examples :**

```
feat/signup-page
ci/github-actions-setup
fix/calendar-input-focus-not-working
```

### Commit messages

**Structure :**

```
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

**Examples :**

```
ci(front): setup storybook tests
fix: send cors headers
feat(groups): add comment section
```

### Node version

We did set up a `.nvmrc` file to allow developers to quickly change and use the right node version. See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) package and [deeper shell integration](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration).
